# Perspective on Data Science

## Stories from Previous Products

He uses a lot of words to give scenarios from his previous work projects, to illustrate challenges with doing data science. Not very interesting to me, so no notes here.

## Theory

There are signs, objects, and interpretants that use the signs to refer to the objects in the world.

In data science, take the above encoding, and use transformations and interpretations to draw conclusions and patterns out of the sets of (sign, object, interpretant) tuples. Take slices of the data, make a hypothesis about it, and see if the hypothesis holds.

From a data set, you want to find a deduction, an induction, or abduction. Deduction is finding a conclusion that comes directly from the data. Abduction is about inferring things about the world that isn't really in the data set. Teasing out abductions is where data science is useful (if the abductions reflect reality)

Computer Science is used to transform the data into an interpretable form, as is Domain Expertise. Then Mathematics/Statistics is the main tool to pull out insights from the data.
