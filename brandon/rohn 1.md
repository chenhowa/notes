You get paid for bringing value to marketplace. It takes time. But you don't get paid for time
You can multiply your value to the marketplace in America.

Low-paid people aren't valuable -- to the marketplace.
High-paid people are super-valuable to the marketplace.

It's an economic ladder to climb
But to do this, you have to work harder on *yourself* than you do on your job, so that you become more valuable to the marketplace

Lessons on climbing the economic ladder:

1. Learn from personal experience. Correct your mistakes. Change each year for the better.
2. Learn from other people's experiences. Both failing people and successful people. Through observation, and through what we hear.
3. Read all the books. Draw from all those stories. "Thank and grow rich". "Richest man in Babylon".
4. Keep a journal. Don't trust your memory, so that if you hear something good, you can write it down. Things that impress you, inspire you, teach you. "Capture value".

Setting goals:

1. Treat the past as a school, not a burden or club
2. The future is a promise. Don't treat it with apprehension. Treat it with anticipation: design your own future well.
3. Decide what you want. Skills, income, location, habits. Think about it. Write a list of it.
4. Keep all your lists of what you want, over time. See how you've grown.
5. When you achieve something on the list, check it off.
6. If the future is clear, the price of achieving it is easy to pay.
7. Setting goals is important, because of what trying to achieve them *makes of you*. Set the kind of goals that will make something of you. And it's what you become that will make you valuable. Set your goals that are high enough, but don't require you to sell out your principles.

Financial independence:

1. Financial independence is the ability to live from the income of your own personal resources.
2. Twenty years is enough to achieve this. But it depends on having a good financial plan.
3. Need the right philosophy - the ability to sort through knowledge and decide value.
4. Philosophy of the poor - Spend money and invest what's left.
5. Philosophy of the rich - Invest money, and spend what's left.
6. "Don't spend the whole dollar".
7. Never spend more than 70 cents of a dollar. 10 cents for charity or worthy projects (teaches character, tithe).
8. Set aside some money from your wages for Active Capital -- money that makes money. Wages make you a living, Profit makes you a fortune. Profits are better than wages.
9. Set aside some money for Passive Capital - letting others use your money, and they pay your interest. This is mutual funds, bonds, lending, etc. Be the lender. The lender is the power position, not the spender.
10. Attitude - paying taxes and bills is good. Paying taxes supports our societies. Paying bills reduces your liability.

Questions to ponder:

1. Why? Why work this hard?
2. Why not? Why not see how much you can do, how valuable you can become, what you can make of yourself?
3. Why not you? Why not you with good self-esteem, making progress, becoming financially independent? If they can do it, why not you?
4. Why not now? Now is a good time.
